[Request]
	‚Ä¢	Migrate all relevant code from the existing ocube-mlops repository that will be used for the second-year development phase.
	‚Ä¢	Clean up the migrated code after migration.

‚∏ª

[Reference]
	‚Ä¢	Update the system flow to the following:
After executing the engine, manage outputs through a modular structure supporting multiple options.
	‚Ä¢	Even if Active Learning is not currently used, manage it as a deactivated module for future potential use.

üìå [Request]
	‚Ä¢	Develop a dispatcher module
	‚Ä¢	Route tasks based on job type (e.g., synchronous/asynchronous, CPU/GPU, model type)
	‚Ä¢	Modular branching logic for flexible execution flow
	‚Ä¢	Implement a Celery-based queue worker system
	‚Ä¢	Consume tasks from queue and execute them asynchronously
	‚Ä¢	Track task status, execution logs, and handle retries
	‚Ä¢	Build a worker module to subscribe to model execution requests
	‚Ä¢	Load model ‚Üí run inference ‚Üí return result
	‚Ä¢	Support structured task input and output format
	‚Ä¢	Add error handling and retry logic
	‚Ä¢	Handle timeouts, failed tasks, and write logs accordingly
	‚Ä¢	Support resource limitation for tasks
	‚Ä¢	Apply per-task memory and core constraints (e.g., using cgexec, taskset)

‚∏ª

üí° [Reference]
	‚Ä¢	Design should allow potential future extension to other queue systems (e.g., Kafka, DB-backed queues)
	‚Ä¢	Dispatcher should support multiple input types: REST API, CLI, scheduled jobs, etc.
	‚Ä¢	Output modules should support multiple options: save to file, generate graph, return via API
	‚Ä¢	Components like Active Learning or alternative execution modules may be registered as inactive modules for future use
	‚Ä¢	Emphasize clean code structure, test coverage, logging, and exception handling throughout the implementation
